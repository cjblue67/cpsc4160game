Project description: Add in collisions, projectiles, and explosions into the project

Extra Contribution: Added star wars theme to project, updated sprites, still hand drawn, just better

Problems with this project: had small difficulty with alignment of sprites, and had trouble figuring out how to get collisions to work

Our project is going to be a side scrolling shooter with a star wars theme. The player pilots an x-wing and has to shoot down tie fighters on the way to the core of the death star. High reaching aspirations for this project would be to have sprite change animation for differing speds exclusively, as well as have when you shoot a tie fighter for it to be replaced by a wreckage sprites that falls off	

Cecilia's Contributions:
